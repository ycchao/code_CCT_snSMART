# code_CCT_snSMART

This repo consists of the R codes to simulate SMART data with binary outcomes, fit the models and plot the power curves for sample size determination described in "Dynamic treatment regimens in small n, sequential multiple assignment, randomized trial: An application in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis" published on Contemporary Clinical Trials. The code was written by Yan-Cheng Chao. 

In particular:
- main.R: This contains most of the R codes to simulate data, fit models and plot the power curves.
- BJSM_6betas_gamma_beta1.bug: This is the BUG code for performing the Bayesian Joint Stage Model.
